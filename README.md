## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/socialmedia_api.git
cd socialmedia_api
```

---

### **Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**
Install all required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **Step 4: Configure Environment**
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root and set environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   DEBUG=True
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
   ```
2. Ensure the `settings.py` file reads these variables.

---

### **Step 5: Run Migrations**
Apply database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### **Step 6: Create Superuser**
Create an admin account for testing:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

### **Step 7: Run the Development Server**
